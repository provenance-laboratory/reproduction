# Paper B (`reproduction`) — internal review packet, round 10

*Every figure below is read from the measurement files, and every claim is lifted from `PHASE-2-FINDINGS.md` rather than retyped. `build_review_packet.py` refuses to write if a figure it prints is absent from that document.*

## ★ THE COVERING NOTE — paste this verbatim

> **This is round 10.** NEITHER REVIEWER BROKE THE AUTHORITY LAYER FOR A SECOND ROUND, and the finding that mattered was one I had dismissed three times. test_controls.py folded a positive-control failure into the attack tally and printed the sum as 'N PASSED THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE' -- a sentence asserting that a control accepted an input it must refuse, when no negative case had passed at all. It was flagged at rounds 6, 7 and 8 and called cosmetic each time. It stopped being cosmetic when two CORRECT repairs met: wiring the suite into the build gate, and shipping runs/det-1/run.json so the builder reaches the suite. Together they made the build refuse on an honest tree, citing an attack that did not happen. Two right repairs making a third defect consequential is this project's recurring shape seen from the other side.
>
> - The security claim and the liveness claim are counted separately. The negative cases carry the security claim, the positive case carries a liveness claim, and BOTH still fail the run because both are real -- a caller can now tell which. The fix was not to force the positive case green: while v9 pends the tree is genuinely red and the positive control genuinely cannot pass, and pretending otherwise would be the substitution this suite exists to catch. Now reads '31 attack(s) refused, 0 PASSED THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE' with the liveness failure reported on its own line.
> - build_package.py reads that distinguishing line rather than the exit code, so a red tree no longer reports itself as a fooled control. Its refusal message said an attack had passed whenever the suite exited non-zero, and the suite exits non-zero for two unrelated reasons.
> - A NAME USED ONLY ON AN ERROR PATH IS A NAME NOBODY EXECUTES UNTIL SOMETHING BREAKS, and four have now shipped -- W in a cleanup reporting a leak, D in a disk pre-flight, D in an audit's own count-fell warning, W in the counter split itself. Each would have raised NameError instead of reporting what it exists to report. symtable answers the question as a property of the code -- which names does a function read from module scope that module scope does not define -- rather than as a list of the symbols that have bitten so far. Its positive control was run by deleting a definition.
> - package/RETIRED.md no longer carries a count nothing computes.
> - RETRACTED, from round 8's own record: 'the tree goes green the moment it anchors' is false. Anchoring is necessary and not sufficient -- the liveness trap is that a table governs only once anchored, so the interval between stamping and anchoring is a window in which the tree is red for a reason no control can distinguish from tampering. check_commitments.py diagnoses that state by name instead of asserting the sentence.
> - v9's table was re-verified against the tree after this round's edits: all 21 paths match the bytes on disk.
>
> ⚠️ **v9 is stamped and PENDING and is NOT SIGNED: its .asc was invalidated when the table was refreshed and has been removed rather than left in place over bytes it does not cover. The positive control fails until it is signed and anchored, and that failure is now reported as a liveness statement about the tree rather than as a security statement about the controls. Nothing here claims a signature that does not exist -- round 8's packet said 'signed' while no signature shipped, which is the error this wording exists to prevent.**

## ⭐ CHECK THE FINDINGS, NOT ONLY THE PACKAGING

```
python reproduce_findings.py     five training runs, ~2 minutes, nothing timed
```

It re-derives the thread partition and the divergence table **on YOUR stack**, from nothing but the corpus and `train.py`.

⛔ **It does not adjudicate the findings, and an earlier version of this packet said it did.** The sentence read *if its numbers disagree with PHASE-2-FINDINGS.md, the findings are wrong* — which is false, because the script measures a DIFFERENT MACHINE. A reviewer whose stack produced one digest across all five thread counts got exactly that disagreement, and the script itself said correctly that this does not contradict configuration A while the packet said it did. Both could not be true.

⇒ To audit the CONFIGURATION-A numbers rather than your own, use the reference bundle: `reference/` ships the arrays and `MEASUREMENT-5-7.json` the derived values, so the published figures can be recomputed from published bytes without training anything.

```
python verify_package.py         the package run in a directory it has never seen
```

## What is measured, and by what

```
m1  cost of pinning     ratio 1.303  95% CI [1.268, 1.343]  sign-test p=4.9e-04  12 pairs
      threads=1  median 6.02 s      threads=16 median 4.62 s
      BLOCKED alternation, paired, execution order kept; both arms PINNED.
      order effect: AB 1.3066 vs BA 1.3118 -- the design's own control, printed
      ⚠ the p is a SIGN TEST, not the randomisation distribution of a
      balanced design, whose space is C(n, n/2) rather than 2^n
      -> report as: roughly +30%, CI [+27%, +34%]. NOT as a decimal percentage
m2  apparatus           202660 bytes on 9530566 of artifact (2.126%); 167631 if train.py and
      build_corpus.py are called artifact instead -- the boundary is arguable and
      measure_storage.py reports it both ways. Timestamp proofs: 5773 bytes
      ⚠ the PERCENTAGE does not transfer: the apparatus is near-
      constant and this artifact is deliberately tiny
m3  REPEATABILITY, same hw one digest across 12 runs at threads=1
      ⛔ NOT REPORTED AS BIT-IDENTITY. Section 6 makes that an
      invalidating condition without an independent re-run. The previous revision of
      the findings said measurement 3 -HOLDS-; that was a violation and is withdrawn.
m4  bit-identity, diff hw  MATCHED-STACK CROSS-MACHINE -- AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX with Radeon Gra, bit-identical True
m5  divergence            step 0 in EVERY array (trace records step -1 as the initial
                           state, and it is identical). relative L2 2.7084e-05, 97.55% of 804096
                           parameters differ between threads 1 and 16
m6  engineering hours     NOT MEASURABLE under this design, and reported as such.
                           The estimand never existed: nothing was made deterministic
m7  monotonicity         NOT monotone: 58.0, 56.0, 86.2, 97.6 per cent differing
      ⛔ AND NOT SEPARABLE FROM THE SEED. Varying only the seed moves the
      differing fraction by 25.4 percentage points and the relative L2 by 6.0x, against a
      thread-count spread of 41.5 points. m7's SHAPE is a claim about one trajectory.

## The thread sweep, read from the runs

```

⭐ **`--unconstrained` produces the threads=16 digest byte for byte**, so 'unconstrained' is not a separate condition on this machine — it is 16 threads. An identification, not an inference.

## ⚠️ Known-weak, and a reviewer should push here

- **n = 2 machines.** Intel and AMD, matched on OS, Python, numpy and the OpenBLAS build -- and BOTH SELECTED THE SAME OpenBLAS MICROKERNEL (Haswell, X86_V3). So measurement 4 shows two vendors running the SAME REDUCTION SHAPE agree, which is not vendor-independence. A machine selecting a different kernel is a different experiment and has not been run.
- **Measurement 1 was +37% in the previous revision and is +30% now.** The design was at fault, not the machine: fixed order, an "unconstrained" arm that was not a condition, and arrays sorted separately before storage. Ask whether the repaired design has its own faults.
- **The model is an MLP, not a transformer.** Defensible — the mechanism under test is BLAS reduction order and capability is explicitly out of scope — but a reviewer may reasonably argue the finding does not transfer to attention kernels or to CUDA, where atomics add a second source of the same phenomenon.
- **Measurement 4 is DESCRIPTIVE, not confirmatory.** Its admissibility conditions were strengthened AFTER its result was known, and it bound itself to no protocol digest. Neither is repairable retroactively. A confirmatory pair needs a fresh run on both machines under the ANCHORED successor, and has not happened -- and train.py's digest moved this round (22cbfeb7 -> f44a74f0) for two recording defects, so the existing pair was produced by a pipeline the current protocol does not pin. The trained weights are identical under both, verified by running both, so no result changes; the RECORD does.
- **Authority is still not EXTERNAL.** The manifest lives in the same directory as the thing it governs; what stops the substitution attack is the anchor and now the signature, not the location. A reviewer asked for CI or signed release metadata to select it. Push on whether an anchor plus a signature by a key WE distribute is enough.
- **⛔ THE `PENDING` BRANCH IS THIS ROUND'S NEW ESCAPE HATCH, and it exists because the obvious strict rule was unusable.** Destroying a higher version's proof is refused now, because falling back to an older document would enforce a SMALLER table. But a document that PARSES, commits to its own bytes and carries only a calendar attestation is allowed to sit above the authority unrefused — otherwise every build would fail for the hours between stamping a successor and its anchor, which is the state v8 is in as this goes out. **That is a convenience rule of exactly the shape the transitional allowance had, and the transitional allowance swallowed an attack last round.** Attack this one.
- **v8 was re-stamped several times while being drafted, and the rule licensing that is stated rather than derived.** §11 says authority attaches at ANCHORING, not at stamping, so a document that has never governed anything may be revised. Every superseded proof is retained under a `.superseded-` name and ships in this packet. Decide whether that is a principled line or a two-hour window in which anything can be quietly rewritten.
- **A signature says a KEY asserted these bytes, and the fingerprint you will check it against comes from us.** `check_signature.py --require` refuses a valid signature by any other key, and prints the fingerprint precisely because this tool cannot establish whose it is. Key distribution is outside the artifact, and the packet does not solve it.
- **`--publishing` now enforces v6 §7's last two conditions, and its first version accepted its own template's placeholder.** `report_to` reading `FILL IN: the URL a reproducer files at...` passed, because the check refused only "", None, TBD and ?; only the close date was caught, and only because a date must PARSE. Look for the same shape elsewhere: a gate that tests the SHAPE of a value rather than the claim it makes.
- **§2c's distribution subset is a new rule with a branch no live input has taken.** It declares which pinned files a reproducer package contains, and the test is an EQUALITY — absent must equal the complement — because a skip would make deletion the way to avoid a digest check. It cannot take effect until v8 anchors, so in THIS package `check_commitments.py` still refuses. The five rule cases in `test_controls.py` are exercised against the declaration rather than the authority, which is honest but is not the same as having run in anger.
- **Measurement 6 is reported NOT MEASURABLE.** Everything else is a digest or a timing a stranger can re-run. That page cannot be checked and says so.
- **The independent reproduction does not exist**, and by section 2b we may not produce one. If nobody answers the call, section 2c pre-registered that silence as a result — a reviewer should decide whether that is a finding or a rationalisation, because it was written before the window opened precisely so that question could be asked.

## ⛔ What the reviewer should NOT accept without pushing

- that a package running on the machine that built it is evidence of anything beyond completeness;
- that the unconstrained runs agreeing three times means unconstrained training is reproducible — they agreed because nothing was contending;
- that about +30% is *the* cost of determinism. It is the cost of pinning to one thread rather than requesting 16, on one configuration, at one size -- and which constraint actually buys identity is a question measurement 4 addresses only for the reduction shape both arms shared; see PHASE-2-FINDINGS section 10.
